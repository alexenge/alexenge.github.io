# welcome

I'm glad you found your way to my website!

I'm Alex and I'm currently a PhD student in Psychology.
My research focuses on how people learn to make sense of the visual world.
For example, I'm studying how our perception of objects changes as we discover their function, or how words get their meaning as children learn to read.
I'm using techniques such as EEG and fMRI to probe the neural correlates of these processes.

I try to do research in a way that is transparent, reproducible, and inclusive.
This may include things like pre-registering studies, publishing preprints, sharing data and code, and contributing to open source software development.

In my spare time, I dabble in long-distance running.

Please feel free to take a look around to learn more!
