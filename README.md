This repository contains the source code for [my personal website](https://alexenge.github.io).

It uses [Quarto](https://quarto.org) with [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) to generate the website.

Some of the code for structuring and styling the website is inspired by [Ella Kaye](https://ellakaye.co.uk/) ([original repo](https://github.com/EllaKaye/ellakaye.co.uk)).
